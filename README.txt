Home security server (AppFuse implementation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the server side of the raspberry-pi home security system.

The system is intended to provide an image upload system for a home
security camera (uploading stills), in order to provide 
an open-source system of this kind.

This is an implementation of the web server using AppFuse.
